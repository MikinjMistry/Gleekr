 (1) Activity Detail API 
---------------------------
==> Count is incorrect when invitation is rejected.



 (2) Archive activity 
------------------------
==> I've added isArchived field to activity schema with default value as false. 
	The archive activity API should check the end dates of all the activities and 
	if their end dates has passed then mark them as archived by updated isArchive field to true. 
	This should be done regardless of user as it will be used to set a chron job which will be triggered every day (i.e once a day).



 (3) Sync contacts 
-----------------------
==> Need to create a new collection named "contacts" which has below fields:
       - number
       - user_id (references to user schema _id)

When sync api is called with the phone contacts, all the contacts needs to be stored in this new collection. 
Filtering should work the way it is working right now - no change required there.

After implementing this change, we might need to make a slight change in the registration process. 
when a user successfully registers and if his number is there in the contact list of any user in contacts collections then we need to remove it from there.
